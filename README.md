# NPRG038 - Advanced C# Programming

This repository contains various materials that I created for my NPRG038 labs. The repository does not always contain all examples that I show in the lab when I use materials created by other lab teachers. You will typically find the additional examples at the [official course page](https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/teaching/nprg038/).

This means that you can copy, distribute and remix the work, but you must give appropriate credit (e.g., by providing a link to the original source).
